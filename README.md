# Clustering
Multiple graph-based algorithms, grid-searched for different k values. Due to time and memory constraints the Faiss library was utilised.

Disclaimer: The implementation of the graph based clustering algorithms is based on the PYJEDAI framework.

Then also kmeans++, Birtch, and Kmedoids were tested, achieving better silhouette scores.
